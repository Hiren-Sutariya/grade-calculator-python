# Python Grade Calculator 

A beginner-friendly Python project that determines a student's grade based on their score using conditional logic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project takes a numerical score as input and evaluates it to display the corresponding grade.  
It is designed to help beginners understand how decision-making works in Python.

---

## ⚙️ How the Program Works
1. The user enters their score.
2. The program validates the score range.
3. Based on the score, a grade is assigned.
4. If the score is invalid, the program asks for verification.

## 🎯 Grade Evaluation Logic
| Score Range | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| 90 – 100   | A     |
| 80 – 89    | B     |
| 70 – 79    | C     |
| 60 – 69    | D     |
| Below 60   | F     |

## 🚫 Input Validation
- Scores above 100 are considered invalid.
- The program prompts the user to verify the entered score.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding decision-making in Python
- Working with user input
- Applying logical conditions
- Writing clean and readable logic

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add support for negative score validation
- Convert to function-based implementation
- Add graphical user interface (GUI)
